# Calculator Project

Wanna save the hassle of mental arithmetic? Well, now you can with Harry's Calculator App. It is like any other calculator, except I made it. 

This is a simple calculator project built using JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## What I Learned

```Refamiliarising myself with basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS```: Following a tutorial and using some creative license, I was able to refamilirise myself with the three coding languages I used primarily when I was beginning to learn how to develop software. I mainly using Python and Cloud Computing services in the day job, so I was keen to build a tiny app to start practising those skills in other technologies I have used once again, to keep those connections alive!

```Remembering how to interact with the DOM```: It was good to practise interacting with the Document Object Model again. I liked being able to pull off accessing all the button elements with ```querySelectorAll``` and using JavaScript code to disable all buttons except 'C' when a calculation had been made. 

```Separating HTML files```: While this is a very small project, it was good to get a sense for how components in an application - in this case, the HTML button elements - can be separated to make the code and the repository that little bit more readable and clean. 

## Instructions

So, wanna be a calculating wizard? Look no further.

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you would like to keep this project in. Once you're there, enter the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator.git

Navigate to the project directory:

    cd calculator

I would recommend opening the repo on VS Code and installing 'Live Server' to locally host the website and see it as you edit it.
